# `Animash`

Many **`developers`** who are migrants from **`pure CSS`** or low level CSS frameworks/libraries like SASS or LESS find it somewhat harder to setup tailwind animations because of it's class utility approach to styling and based off react and recent js libraries. What `Animash` aims to solve is to create a source depot where all you have to do is copy the code or better still get your inspiration from the codes displayed, so as to have an idea on how animation works in tailwind CSS. 

These code listings are going to focus majorly on `React Components` as it's starting point. But I know that with that you can get the foundations of how everything works.
